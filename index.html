<p>BTS (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan; lit. Bulletproof Boy Scouts), 
    also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a South Korean boy band formed in 2010. 
    The band consists of Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook, who co-write 
    and co-produce the majority of their material. Originally a hip hop group, their 
    musical style has evolved to incorporate a wide range of genres, while their lyricism 
    has focused on subjects including mental health, the troubles of school-age youth and 
    coming of age, loss, the journey towards self-love, individualism, and the consequences of 
    fame and recognition. Their discography and adjacent work has also referenced literature, 
    philosophy and psychological concepts, and includes an alternate universe storyline.</p>
